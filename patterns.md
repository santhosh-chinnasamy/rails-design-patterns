# Design Patterns ?

Design patterns are some of the best practices that you should follow while composing your applicationâ€™s code architecture to enhance readability and be able to maintain it better in the future. Design patterns also help reduce resource leaks and common mistakes since you must follow a pre-tested style of designing your codebase.

Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.

# Why use design patterns?

- faster development
- easier maintenance
- easier testing
- more readable and self-documenting

## Services

The service design pattern breaks down a program into its functional constituents. Each service object completes one task, such as sending reset password emails, or creating a new user.

[refer UserService](app/services/user_service.rb)

## Form Objects

The form design pattern encapsulates the logic related to data validation and persistence into a single unit. As a result, it can often separate the logic from the views and make the form unit reusable throughout the codebase.

[refer UserForm](app/forms/user_form.rb)

## Presenter

The presenter design pattern is used to separate the logic from the view.

[refer UserPresenter](app/presenters/user_presenter.rb)
